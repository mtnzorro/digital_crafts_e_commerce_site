##Overview:

The Ugly Sweater Store is a full stack e-commerce mock site, utilizing AngularJS on the front end, and Flask/PostGreSql on the back end.  Our assignment was to build a functional back end, with a set of API's that could provide the functionality that we would need for displaying the current inventory, displaying individual items, shopping cart, checkout, and secure login and account functionality.  Finally we implemented the Stripe payment system, were able to confirm transactions through their demo portal.
